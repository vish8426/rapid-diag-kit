Rapid Diagnostic Test Kit

## About
The following report will discuss the design, implementation and feasibility of the Rapid Diagnostic Test Kit (RDTK) that will be used to detect Malaria within poor rural,
such as the Duse Village in Kenya. 
 
The conceptualisation and design of the product stemmed from the analysis of healthcare needs within the Duse Village in Kenya, which basic safety requirements in Maslow's  hierarchy of needs. More specifically, the product targets the ability to diagnose, and therefore treat Malaria, which is responsible for over 3.5 million cases and 10000 deaths in Kenya each year. Malaria is a particularly serious issue in less developed rural communities that don't offer the necessary equipment for diagnosis and treatment of malaria. It affects young children and pregnant women more seriously which accounts for over 60% of all deaths. (World Health Organisation, 2014).

The RDTK aims to provide a widely accessible test kit that offers all that is needed for a quick 15-30 minute detection test for malaria in communities that don't have access to typical testing equipment. It will consist of a visual test stick and disposable lancet needle, which will adopt a very minimalistic portable design with the use of cheap materials.
