Rapid Diagnostic Test Kit

## About
The following report will discuss the design, implementation and feasibility of the Rapid Diagnostic Test Kit (RDTK) that will be used to detect Malaria within poor rural,
such as the Duse Village in Kenya. 
 
The conceptualisation and design of the product stemmed from the analysis of healthcare needs within the Duse Village in Kenya, which basic safety requirements in Maslow's  hierarchy of needs. More specifically, the product targets the ability to diagnose, and therefore treat Malaria, which is responsible for over 3.5 million cases and 10000 deaths in Kenya each year. Malaria is a particularly serious issue in less developed rural communities that don't offer the necessary equipment for diagnosis and treatment of malaria. It affects young children and pregnant women more seriously which accounts for over 60% of all deaths. (World Health Organisation, 2014).

The RDTK aims to provide a widely accessible test kit that offers all that is needed for a quick 15-30 minute detection test for malaria in communities that don't have access to typical testing equipment. It will consist of a visual test stick and disposable lancet needle, which will adopt a very minimalistic portable design with the use of cheap materials.

## Overview

Malaria remains a significant health challenge in Kenya, with over 3.5 million cases and 10,000 deaths annually. Vulnerable populations, including young children and pregnant women, are disproportionately affected, accounting for more than 60% of malaria-related deaths. The RDTK project addresses this issue by developing a diagnostic tool tailored for low-resource settings, enabling timely detection and treatment of malaria :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

## Design Objectives

- **Accessibility**: Ensure the kit is affordable and usable in remote areas with limited healthcare infrastructure.
- **Simplicity**: Design the kit for ease of use by individuals with minimal medical training.
- **Portability**: Create a compact and lightweight kit for easy transportation and deployment.
- **Rapid Results**: Provide quick diagnostic results within 15â€“30 minutes to facilitate prompt treatment.

## Key Features

- **Visual Test Stick**: Offers a clear, easy-to-interpret indication of malaria presence.
- **Disposable Lancet Needle**: Allows for safe and hygienic blood sample collection.
- **Minimalistic Design**: Utilizes cost-effective materials to keep production costs low.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for straightforward operation without the need for specialized equipment.

## Target Use Case

The RDTK is intended for deployment in rural communities lacking access to conventional diagnostic facilities. By enabling early detection of malaria, the kit aims to reduce mortality rates and improve health outcomes in these underserved regions.
